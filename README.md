# Plagiarism-detection-on-Clough-Stevenson-corpus-dataset-using-unsupervised-learning-techniques-
In this project we are aiming to create a system which will detect the plagiarism between the documents using K-means algorithm and FP-growth algorithm. We will create clusters of similar words using k-means. We create a vector for each sentence in the document and based on the similarity we assign them to respective clustering number. We repeat the same process to create a vector document using the sentence vectors generated, which we can use as item-sets in the FP-Growth Algorithm and the number of documents will be our transactions. Once we get frequent item sets we know which documents are plagiarized from each other.
